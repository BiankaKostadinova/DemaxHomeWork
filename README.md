In the current solution is described how we could find duplicate elements into
  two sorted data structures. The optimal way to do that is Linear complexity
  with arrays. That is because In the linear equation the value of coefficient is 
 always equals to 0, which disturbs the pattern of the quadratic equation ax² and makes
 it the linear equation. Further a linear equation doesn’t have any power higher than 
 one of its own and it has the straight line form of ax+by+c=0 where the a,b,c are the 
 respective constants.

 Example: 
 If the input is larger number, quadratic would get that and pow to 2, that means 
 will consume twice more resources and time than linear.
 Linear will execute only based on the input.

*Usage*

Run Start.java file.
